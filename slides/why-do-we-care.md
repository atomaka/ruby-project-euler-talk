##  Why is this relevant

* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
  * Programming problems
  * Computational mathematics
  * Most (all?) problems can be bruteforced
  * All problems can be solved in a minute

note:
    Each of these problems can be solved in a program that takes less than one
    minute to run on a modest computer with an efficient algorithm.

    Inefficient solutions can take much more.

    Example: was solving a problem.  Wrote brute force solution and ran it.  Two
    hours later, I solved with an efficient algorithm. Two hours after that, my
    brute force solution completed.
